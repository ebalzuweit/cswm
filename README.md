## Usage

cswm is designed to be straightforward -
there are no keybindings and little user configuration.

While running, cswm automatically manages active windows on the user's desktop.
It will arrange the active windows like a tiling window manager,
moving and resizing them to fill the screen without overlapping.
You can rearrange windows by dragging them from one space to another.
You can adjust the tiling by resizing the window border (or corner) adjacent to the partition.

cswm runs in the system tray, right-click on the icon to access the user menu.
